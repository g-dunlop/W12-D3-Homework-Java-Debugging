Answer the following questions:
1. What is the purpose of a breakpoint?
    
    - Allows you to pinpoint the section of the code where program is breaking

2. Does the line of code on a breakpoint run when you start debugging?

    - No

3. How do we debug the next line of code?

    - "StepOver"

4. What does the step into command do?

    - takes you to the Class from the test and then pauses at the first line of the method being called in the test.

5. What is the difference between evaluate expression and evaluate code fragment?

    - evaluate expression allows us to calculate values from one line of code whereas a fragment can be several lines and include, for example, some temporary variables.
